 * <p>This interface defines access to the model ( @see org.deegree.portal.context.ViewContext )
 * a map based on. A concret implementation is responsible for handling the
 * context. E.g. an implementation may adds additional capabilities like
 * a history function.</p>
 * <p>Several methods expects beside the name of a layer the address (URL) of the
 * OWS that serves this layer. This is required because a ViewContext may offeres
 * layers from more than one OWS and there is no rule that says that a layers
 * name must be unique across several OWS. So the only way to identify a layer
 * is to use the combination of layer name, service address and service type
 * (maybe several services are published to the same address; e.g. deegree 2
 * will do this).</p>
 * <p>Notice: All changed e.g. removeLayer just will be made to a ViewContext and not to the
 * service providing a layer.
