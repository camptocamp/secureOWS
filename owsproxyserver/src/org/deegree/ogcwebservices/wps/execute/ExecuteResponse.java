/**
 * ExecuteResponseType.java
 * 
 * Created on 09.03.2006. 23:16:26h
 * 
 * 
 * WPS Execute operation response. By default, this XML document is delivered to
 * the client in response to an Execute request. If "status" is "false" in the
 * Execute operation request, this document is normally returned when process
 * execution has been completed. If "status" in the Execute request is "true",
 * this response shall be returned as soon as the Execute request has been
 * accepted for processing. In this case, the same XML document is also made
 * available as a web-accessible resource from the URL identified in the
 * statusLocation, and the WPS server shall repopulate it once the process has
 * completed. It may repopulate it on an ongoing basis while the process is
 * executing. However, the response to an Execute request will not include this
 * element in the special case where the output is a single complex value result
 * and the Execute request indicates that "store" is "false". Instead, the
 * server shall return the complex result (e.g., GIF image or GML) directly,
 * without encoding it in the ExecuteResponse. If processing fails in this
 * special case, the normal ExecuteResponse shall be sent, with the error
 * condition indicated. This option is provided to simplify the programming
 * required for simple clients and for service chaining.
