/**
 * Layers may have zero or more <BoundingBox> elements that are either stated
 * explicitly or inherited from a parent Layer. Each BoundingBox states the
 * bounding rectangle of the map data in a particular spatial reference system;
 * the attribute SRS indicates which SRS applies. If the data area is shaped
 * irregularly then the BoundingBox gives the minimum enclosing rectangle.The
 * attributes minx, miny, maxx, maxy indicate the edges of the bounding box in
 * units of the specified SRS. Optional resx and resy attributes indicate the
 * spatial resolution of the data in those same units.
 * <p></p>
 * A Layer may have multiple BoundingBox element, but each one shall state a
 * different SRS. A Layer inherits any BoundingBox values defined by its parents.
 * A BoundingBox inherited from the parent Layer for a particular SRS is replaced
 * by any declaration for the same SRS in the child Layer. A BoundingBox in the
 * child for a new SRS not already declared by the parent is added to the list
 * of bounding boxes for the child Layer. A single Layer element shall not
 * contain more than one BoundingBox for the same SRS.
