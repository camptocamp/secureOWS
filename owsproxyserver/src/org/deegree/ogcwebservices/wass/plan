The Plan:

this shall be the file where plans/TODO/FIXME lists should go. This may prevent double implementations,
search orgies and other fun stuff.

What Andreas S. is up to:
 * Added a SessionLifetime deegree parameter.
 * Added database parameters to the capabilities.
   Changed WASS to use the standard IODocument/JDBCConnection deegree tool classes.

What Rutger is doing:  

General structure:

 * Maybe we should start a new trend and make a handler package?
 * Where to put it what to put into.
 * Well, put it in common and in wss/operation and call it handler. Put handlers in.

General thoughts:

 * Caching: should services be cached? I saw something about a "pool" somewhere, so maybe the static create
   methods that call our constructors and/or the service factory classes should cache some service instances.
 * Not jet, the services are created as new instances for the moment though in the future there will be
   a pooling mechanism.

Suggested next steps:
