  {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.Coverage Coverages} (generate a value for any point). The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">OpenGIS&reg; Grid Coverages Implementation Specification</A>.

  <P ALIGN="justify">The architecture of the grid coverage specification is composed of three
  packages. The specification includes a package for the general coverage specification (CV),
  a package specifically for grid coverages (GC) and a package for grid coverage processing (GP).
  The GP package is optional and not required for an OGC compliant implementation.</P>

  <H2>Color Palettes</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">A coverage can have a color palette. A color palette is valid for only
  coverages which are integer values (usually bytes). Color palettes supported include gray
  scale, RGB, HLS and CMYK. The coverage dimension information maps the grid sample dimensions
  to a color palette or to color model components. For example 8-bit pseudo color TIFF image
  would be represented as a grid with one sample dimension and a color palette with 256 RGB
  entries. A 24-bit RGB TIFF file would be represented as a grid with three bands and no color
  palette. The dimension information would indicate which bands to use for the RGB color components.
  The following illustrates example values for different color components:</P>

  <TABLE CELLPADDING='6'>
    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#GRAY Gray Scale}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains one entry which a shade of gray. 0 is black and 255 is white.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#RGB RGB}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains three values: Red Green Blue. Each value ranges from 0 to 255
        where 0 is no intensity and 255 is maximum intensity.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#RGB RGBA}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains four values RGBA: Red Green Blue Alpha. The alpha value is the
        level of transparency of the color. Alpha of 0 is transparent and 255 is opaque.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#HLS HLS}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains three values: Hue Saturation Lightness. Hue is a value from 0 to
        360. Saturation is a value from 0 to 100 where 0 is no color intensity and 100 is
        full color intensity. Lightness is a value from 0 to 100 where 0 is no lightness
        and 100 is full lightness.</TD></TR>

    <TR><TD NOWRAP BGCOLOR='lightgray'>{@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.PaletteInterpretation#CMYK CMYK}</TD>
    <TD>Vector contains four values: Cyan Magenta Yellow Black. Each value ranges from
        0 to 255 where 0 is no intensity and 255 is maximum intensity.</TD></TR>
